Welcome! This is a little project that I'm working on to practice my Javascript. 

The goal of this project is to build a web application that makes it easy to create and manage a character sheet for the d20 tabletop gaming system, and to do so using only HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Eventually, to store/retrieve this information, we'll probably want to use PHP & MySQL, but I'm not married to that.

For v1.0, I'm keeping things relatively simple. 
	-We're only building Level 1 characters for now, so by extension, we're not handling cross-class characters yet.
	-We're only using material that is available under the Open Game License; see LICENSE.txt for legal and copyright info. Homebrew, pathfinder, etc... could be added in the future.
