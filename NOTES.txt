BASIC PLAN:
1) Identify a choice one makes when creating a character. Example: picking a class.
2) Add an appropriate input to create.html for this choice. Example: a <select>, with each class as an <option>.
3) Add this field to the database table `character` and to insert_process.php. Example: selectClass added as a column in the database, and a variable in the php.
	3.1) Test to see if info is being added and stored in database.
4) Identify information that is determined by this choice. Example: base HP, starting gold, saves, BaB, etc...
5) Add fields for this dependent information. Example: a readonly "number" input for HP.
6) Code a JS function (or functions) to fill in this dependent information whenever the original input is modified, or when the character update form is loaded. Example: setClassFeatures() and setHP() determine a character's full HP.
	6.1) Test to see if function(s) work as intended, and what other user-adjustable fields are/should be triggering functions.
7) Copy HTML from create.html to update.php; replace values on user-adjustable fields with php to pull this info from the database.
8) Add new JS function(s) to update.php's <body onload="">.
9) Add new fields to update_process.php.
	9.1) Test to see if update_process is modifying database fields as intended.

EVERY *DATABASE* FIELD needs to exist in these places:
	1) The `characters` database, in the `character` table. Each field should have a corresponding column.
	2) create.html
	3) insert_process.php
	4) update.php
	5) update_process.php
	
SOME FIELDS also show up in these places:
	1) index.php
	2) delete.php
	
THE REST are just dependent on database fields. They aren't set by the user. Therefor, you only see them in create.html and update.php, and they're calculated by gazebo-functions.js.
