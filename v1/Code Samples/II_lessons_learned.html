				<p><span class="firstcharacter">W</span>hat is the humanitarian sector’s capacity to carry forward lessons learned regarding the challenges mentioned in the previous section? The aforementioned confidential nature of negotiations has evidently served as an impediment to sharing experiences and lessons learned across the sector. Indeed, as mentioned earlier, in certain complex environments where sensitive negotiations occurred, frontline negotiators did not even inform superiors within their own organization about ongoing negotiation efforts.<sup><a href="references.html#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Ibid., at 10">[39]</a></sup> The humanitarian sector has also been slow to appreciate the important role that negotiations play in the success of humanitarian operations,<sup><a href="references.html#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" data-toggle="tooltip" title="For an assessment of how this factor affected humanitarian negotiations in Iraq, see Claudia Rodriguez, “Negotiating the legitimacy of humanitarian action in Iraq,” in Humanitarian Diplomacy: Practitioners and Their Craft, eds. Larry Minear and Hazel Smith (Tokyo: United Nations University, 2007), 125">[40]</a></sup> and as one policy document mentions, “[n]o [c]ommon [n]egotiating [c]ulture” exists across the sector.<sup><a href="references.html#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mancini-Griffoli and Picot, supra note 30, at 29">[41]</a></sup> These factors are reflected in three gaps in the exiting body of literature on humanitarian negotiation, as the rest of this section discusses.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-6 col-lg-8">
				<p>First, literature on past humanitarian negotiation experiences focuses primarily on context-specific case studies. To date, no analysis has been conducted of how negotiators in different contexts have approached cross cutting challenges, such as the issues examined in the previous section of this paper. This literature gap suggests a perception that negotiations are context-specific, and that experiences in, for example, Colombia, might not helpfully inform negotiations in another region, such as the Middle East or Africa. The assessment of the key challenges presented in this paper, though, suggests the opposite conclusion. Indeed, in Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa — though some elements of negotiation efforts are, of course, specific to each individual context — negotiators face similar overarching challenges, and lessons learned in one region could apply elsewhere as well.&nbsp;</p>

				<p>Second, there is a dearth of analysis geared toward garnering a conceptual understanding of humanitarian negotiations. Despite the fact that there is a vast body of literature addressing the role that factors such as power, interests, relationships, basic human needs, and culture play in commercial, legal, and political negotiations,<sup><a href="references.html#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" data-toggle="tooltip" title="For examples, see generally Roger Fisher, William Ury, and Bruce Patton, Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In (New York: Penguin Books, 1991); Gary T. Lowenthal, “A General Theory of Negotiation Process, Strategy, and Behavior,” 31 University of Kansas Law Review 69 (1982-1983); Dennis Sandole, "Extending the Reach of Basic Human Needs: A Comprehensive Theory for the Twenty-first Century," in Conflict Resolution and Human Needs: Linking Theory and Practice, eds. Kevin Avruch and Christopher Mitchell (New York: Routledge, 2013); and Jeswald W. Salacuse, The Global Negotiator: Making, Managing, and Mending Deals Around the World in the Twenty-first Century (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2003)">[42]</a></sup> no literature exists that applies these conceptual frameworks to the field of humanitarian negotiation. Indeed, a perception pervades that humanitarian negotiations are unique. For example, recall the aforementioned quote from an OCHA policy document, which states, “Humanitarian negotiations differ from many other types of negotiations because the parties to the negotiations have different core interests (…).”<sup><a href="references.html#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" data-toggle="tooltip" title="McHugh and Bessler, supra note 4, at 50">[43]</a></sup> This perception has led analysts of humanitarian negotiations to shy away from marrying the practice of humanitarian negotiation with the wealth of valuable literature that focuses on other negotiation contexts. As a result, existing literature offers little analysis of how humanitarian negotiations unfold and how past successes and failures can be explained.</p>

			<div class="col-6 col-lg-8">
				<p>Third, a foundational body of policy literature has been produced that addresses the key challenges faced, but various questions remain about the practical realities of negotiation efforts. What role do humanitarian principles actually play — and what role can and should principles actually play — in negotiation efforts? When are tactics such as threatening to pull out of negotiations or resorting to public denunciation appropriate, and when might such tactics harm negotiation efforts? How can organizations strike a balance between, on the one hand, the need to keep negotiations confidential and to grant negotiators room to maneuver compromises, and on the other hand, to coordinate on negotiations with other organizations operating in the same context? How can negotiators develop quick and useful assessments of interlocutors in a rapidly evolving environment where information about entities that control territory is difficult to obtain? Professional engagement with humanitarian negotiators from different organizations and across different geographic contexts can build on the policy guidance previously generated to illuminate how practitioners have grappled with these questions in past negotiation efforts and fill an existing policy guidance gap.</p>
