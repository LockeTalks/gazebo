In the summer of 2016, I set out to learn the fundamentals of web development. I took Mark Lassoff's "Become a certified web developer" course through Udemy. (https://www.udemy.com/become-a-certified-web-developer) The course complete, I wanted something relatively complex on which to practice my newfound skills. Specifically, I wanted to build a CrUD app -- similar to the one I had just built in the course, but larger and more complicated. So I decided to build something that would make it easy to create a character for the d20 roleplaying system.

My reasons for choosing this pen-and-paper system were as follows:
	(1) As long as I followed the stipulations of the Open Game License, I'd be able to use lots of pre-existing content for free.
	(2) I already knew the system quite well, so there was nothing much to learn in that regard.
	(3) There were already tons of web apps out there for this system, so there would be plenty of things to look at for inspiration and/or imitation.
	(4) Yet I couldn't find a web app that really did what I was looking for: take all the guesswork out of character creation. In other words, I wanted something that would only let you put a feat on your character sheet if you qualified for it; that did all the math for you when it came to saves and skill modifiers and such; that let you easily buy starting equipment.
	
So, on and off for several months, I built this THING, using only JavaScript, HTML, and a touch of CSS. I called it "Gazebo," because of a legend from the early days of table-top roleplaying. Everything from those months is in the folder labeled "v1," and if you launch gazebo.html, you'll find a kind of complex calculator that lets you set ability scores using a 25-point buy, and fills in a bunch of info based on race and class selections. The skills and feats sections are wonky and incomplete. 

I learned a lot building Gazebo v1. So much, in fact, that I decided to blow the whole thing up and start over again. After all, this is something I often wish I could do professionally -- take a second crack at a project after completing it, drawing on the lessons learned when creating it the first time. We don't get to do that in real life, but this project has always been about "learning by doing," and no one's in charge of it but me. So now I'm doing it again.

The first time around, I wasn't concerned about look and feel, nor was I worrying about making this thing actually usable -- like by making it possible to save your characters. I just wanted to figure out HOW one could build a point buy calculator, or HOW one could manage the complex interdependencies of a d20 character. This time, I AM concerned about those things, so there are two big new things:
	(1) For look and feel, as well as some other functions, I'm using Bootstrap. I'd tinkered with Bootstrap before, even built a few microsites with it, but here I'm going to really "open her up" as my dad likes to say about his car. Hooray for Bootstrap!
	(2) I'm building in a PHP Development Stack with Apache (running on standard HTTP port - 80), PHP, MySQL (root user without password), phpMyAdmin and Composer preinstalled. This means characters can now be saved, edited, and deleted, all with the magic of PHP-executed SQL commands. It also makes the whole project roughly 3 times bigger and more complex. But hey, that's part of the fun!
	
So here I am. Just started v2 TODAY, 2/3/17. I set up the bare bones of the app, which is just a database of character names and levels, each with a unique character ID (charId). The plan is to add fields one at a time, slowly and carefully, testing each step. I'm going to re-use stuff from v1 where I can (the point buy calculator especially) and make new stuff as I need it. That's the story for now.
